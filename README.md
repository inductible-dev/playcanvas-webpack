# Using Webpack to Build a PlayCanvas App

There are lots of options for building a PlayCanvas app. One is to use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), a popular JavaScript bundler.

## How to Build

Run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will output `dist/main.js`.

## How to Run

Once you have built the app, you can load it from `dist/index.html` (via a local web server). 

You should now be able to see a spinning cube.
